# Basics

Open your bash console, and type:

```
node
```

You are now at the NodeJS command-line, ready to give javascript commands. Now run the following commands:

``` js
var message;
message = 'hello node';
console.log(message);
var obj = { 'param': 'value', 'number':5 }
console.log(obj.param + ' / ' + obj.number);
```

As you can see, any javascript command can be executed. Now have some fun experimenting, we will discuss afterwards.
